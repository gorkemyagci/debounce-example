## Debounce Technique

The debounce technique is a JavaScript method used to reduce unnecessary processing costs while handling user interactions. It's particularly useful in functions that track user interactions, such as listening to user inputs in search boxes. The primary purpose of this technique is to group consecutive calls over a certain delay period and execute only the last call. This can help reduce unnecessary CPU usage and improve performance.

## How It Works

The debounce technique sets a delay period when invoking a function. If the time interval between consecutive calls to the function is shorter than this delay period, it delays each call and executes only the last one. This is especially beneficial for fast and continuously triggered events like user inputs. For example, you might want to send an API request every time a character is typed into a search box. However, instead of sending a request for each character input, it may be more efficient to send a single request when the user has finished typing over a certain delay period.
